		<h3>Structure of the Quality Model</h3> 
		
		Here we give a brief overview of the structure of the quality model.

		<p>
		The main concept of the quality model are <i>Factors</i>. A factor expresses a property of an
		entity. We describe with entities the things that are important for quality. Properties describe 
		the attributes of the things we are interested in. 
		</p>
		
		<p>This concept of a factor is rather general. Thus, we use it on two levels of abstraction:
		<ol>
			<li><i>Quality Aspects</i> describe abstract quality goals defined for the whole product. In
				our quality model we use the "-ilities" of ISO 25010 as quality aspects. Typical examples
				for such quality aspects are <i>Maintainability</i>, <i>Analysability</i>, and <i>Modifiability</i>.
			</li>
			<li><i>Product Factors</i> describe concrete, measurable properties of concrete entities. An example
				for a factor is the <i>Complexity of a method</i>, which can be measured by the cyclomatic complexity
				number, or by the nesting depth of the method. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To close the gap between abstract quality aspects and measurable product factors, we need to set
		the product factors in relation to the quality aspects. This is done via <i>Impacts</i>. An impact 
		is either positive or negative and describes how the degree of presence or absence of a product factor 
		influences a quality aspect. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		A third layer in the levels of abstraction are <i>Measures</i>, which describe how a specify product factor
		can be quantified. To realize the connection to concrete tools in a quality assessment, we further introduce
		<i>Instruments</i>. An instrument describes a concrete implementation of a measure. For the example of the 
		nesting depth, an instrument is the corresponding metric as implemented in the quality analysis framework
		ConQAT. This way, different tools can be used for a single measure. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In order to fully operationalize the quality model we need to specify aggregation formulas. They are
		called <i>Evaluations</i> and they are assigned to the factors in the quality model.
