Examples:<br/>Creative Miss-spelling:  If you must use descriptive variable and function names, misspell them. By misspelling in some function and variable names, and spelling it correctly in others (such as SetPintleOpening SetPintalClosing) we effectively negate the use of grep or IDE search techniques. It works amazingly well. Add an international flavor by spelling tory or tori in different theaters.<br/>Single Letter Variable Names: If you call your variables a, b, c, then it will be impossible to search for instances of them using a simple text editor. Further, nobody will be able to guess what they are for. If anyone even hints at breaking the tradition honored since FØRTRAN of using i, j, and k for indexing variables, namely replacing them with ii, jj and kk, warn them about what the Spanish Inquisition did to heretics.<br/>A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.S.: Use acronyms to keep the code terse. Real men never define acronyms; they understand them genetically. If you confuse even yourself with acronyms, secretly write code using meaningful names, then, when the code in working, use the global rename feature of Eclipse to give your variables and methods unintelligible names and acronyms, just the way a mechanical obfuscator would.<br/>CapiTaliSaTion: Randomly capitalize the first letter of a syllable in the middle of a word.<br/><br/>Scale: Percentage of identifiers with misspelled or cryptic names
