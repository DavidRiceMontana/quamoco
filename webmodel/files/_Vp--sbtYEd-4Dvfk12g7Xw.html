Misleading names: Make sure that every method does a little bit more (or less) than its name suggests. As a simple example, a method named isValid(x) should as a side effect convert x to binary and store the result in a database.<br/>Be Abstract: In naming functions and variables, make heavy use of abstract words like it, everything, data, handle, stuff, do, routine, perform and the digits e.g. routineX48, PerformDataFunction, DoIt, HandleStuff and do_args_method.<br/>New Uses For Names For Baby: Buy a copy of a baby naming book and you’ll never be at a loss for variable names. Fred is a wonderful name, and easy to type. If you’re looking for easy-to-type variable names, try adsf or aoeu if you type with a DSK keyboard.<br/>Names from Mathematics: Choose variable names that masquerade as mathematical operators, e.g.: openParen = ( slash + asterix ) / equals;<br/>Bedazzling Names: Choose variable names with irrelevant emotional connotation, e. g.:<br/>marypoppins = ( superman + starship ) / god; <br/>This confuses the reader because they have difficulty disassociating the emotional connotations of the words from the logic they’re trying to think about.<br/>Obscure film references: Use constant names like LancelotsFavouriteColour instead of blue and assign it hex value of 0x0204FB. The color looks identical to pure blue on the screen, and a maintenance programmer would have to work out 0204FB (or use some graphic tool) to know what it looks like. Only someone intimately familiar with Monty Python and the Holy Grail would know that Lancelot’s favorite color was blue. If a maintenance programmer can’t quote entire Monty Python movies from memory, he or she has no business being a programmer.<br/><br/>Scale: Percentage of identifiers with meaningless or misleading names
