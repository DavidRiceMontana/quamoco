<h1>QIESL Evaluation</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
An evaluation using QIESL to specify
how either the results of measures or the results of evaluations of refining and impacting
factors are translated into points. 
</div>

<h2>General Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>QIESL is a language based on Java. Adhere to the Java language syntax.</li>
	
	<li>
		The final result of the evaluation is expected to be assigned to the pre-defined variable
		<i>result</i>.
	</li>

	<li>The details differ depending on what kind of factor you want to evaluate:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#productfactor">Product factor</a></li>
			<li><a href="#otherfactors">Other factors</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h1>Product Factor</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
An evaluation describes how the degree to which a factor is present in the system is calculated.
This degree can be calculated using the <a href="Factor.html">factors</a> refining a factor, or 
using the <a href="Measure.html">measures</a> measuring the factor.
<br>
In particular, the
evaluation uses the Quamoco Impact Evaluation Specification Language (QIESL) to specify
how the results of the measures are translated into points. These points do not express
whether this is good or bad for quality, but only the degree of presence of the factor.
For example, the factor <i>Statically unused @Source code part</i> gets the more points,
the more source code parts are statically unused.
</div>

<ol>
    <li>The <a href="Measure.html">measures</a> that you can use in the evaluation
    of the product factor are shown in the table <i>Available Measures</i>. These are
    the measures that are in the <i>measured by</i> relation to the factor. </li>
    
    <li>
    	A factor always expresses to which degree it is present <b>in the entire system</b>. 
    	Therefore, single measurement values (such as findings) must be normalized.
    	A common form of normalization is to take the size of the single parts into account, 
    	i.e. larger parts of the system have a larger influence on the resulting value.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		In order to normalize <i>Findings</i>, so called <i>Ranges</i> are supported. Using
		a <i>methodRange</i> to normalize findings, means that if a method contains 
		a finding, than the entire method is considers as affected by the finding. The 
		normalization then calculates the ratio: 
		<span style="font-family:Fixedsys,Courier,monospace;">(size of affected methods)/(size of all methods)</span>.
	</li>
        
	<li>
		If you do not have more information, distribute the maximum number of points
		evenly over the measures and normalize by a suitable range that is affected. 
		Examples for ranges are <i>classRange</i> or <i>methodRange</i>. 
		<br>
		Because it is very time consuming and error prone to manually write 
		QIESL formulas, you can use the graphical interface to do so, by clicking the
		Tab &quot;Evaluation function&quot; in the properties view, or by using the button 
		<i>Gen. standard QIESL with Ranges</i>.
	</li>

	<li>
		In some cases, it is more natural not to normalize by <i>Ranges</i>. For
		example, one could also normalize by the number of classes: 
		<span style="font-family:Fixedsys,Courier,monospace;">(number of affected methods)/(number of all methods)</span>.
		The precondition to use such normalizations, is that there is a measure in the model that is
		able to calcualte the <i>number of methods</i>. These <a href="Measure.html">measures</a> are explicitly 
		flagged as normalization measures. 
	</li>
</ol>


<a name="otherfactors" />
<h1>Other Factors</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
For other factors, an evaluation describes how the evaluations of the factors that refine, influence,
or implement
the current factors are combined to its result. In many cases, the current factor will not
know all of these factors, because they can be in other models. Then, we can use a standard
mean function. If the influencing or refining factors are in the same model, the can also be
directly included in the evaluation.
</div>

<ol>
    <li>
    	As a first step, just use <i>mean(allImpactsAndRefinements)</i> to calculate the
    	average points of all influencing, implementing, and refining factors.
    	<br>
    	The constant <i>allImpactsAndRefinements</i> does automatically invert the points of
    	the factors with a negative impact.
    	<br>
    	<b>Example:</b>
    	<br>
    	Factor A is influenced by B positively.
    	<br>
    	Factor A is influenced by C negatively.
    	<br>
    	The evaluation of A: 
    	<span style="font-family:Fixedsys,Courier,monospace;">mean(allImpactsAndRefinements)</span>
    	results in:
    	<span style="font-family:Fixedsys,Courier,monospace;">
    		mean(value(B),maxPointsOf(C)-value(C))</span>
    </li>
</ol>
