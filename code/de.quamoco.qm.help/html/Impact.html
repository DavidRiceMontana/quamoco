<h1>Impact</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
The <i>Impact</i> concept defines an influence of one factor to another. More precisely, 
an impact specifies that the degree of which a product possesses a factor influences the 
degree of which the product possesses another factor. The effect of the influence can be 
either positive or negative. If the impact has a positive effect, the degree of which the 
product possesses the target factor is heightened if the product possesses the source factor. 
In contrast, if the impact has a negative effect, the degree of which the target factor is 
possessed by the product is hindered if the product possesses the source factor. Please note 
that therefore a positive impact does not mean that the involved factors are required from a 
quality perspective. For each impact, a rationale, i.e. a detailed justification that describes 
the impact, needs to be specified. It is crucial to provide a rational, since this ensures that 
the model contains only relevant impacts.

<h2>General Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		In the base model, impact should only be used between different types of factors. More
		precisely, only <a href="Factor.html#productfactor">product factors</a> must have an impact on
		<a href="Factor.html#ilitiesfactor">-ilities factors</a> or 
		<a href="Factor.html#usecasefactor">Use case factors</a>. These two types of factors may
		have impact on <a href="FacotBase.html#satisfactionfactor">stakeholder satisfaction factors</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Justify for each impact, the reason why the factor has a direct effect on the other factor.
		This is helpful to ensure that a quality model defines only relevant impacts.
	</li>
	<li>
		The justification must have clear why the impact is either <i>positive</i> or <i>negative</i>.
	</li>	
</ol>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<a name="justification" />
<h3 class="attribute">Justification</h3> 
<ol>
	<li>
		Provide a textual description of the rational, why the impact exists, and why it is
		either <i>positive</i> or <i>negative</i>.
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="effect" />
<h3 class="attribute">Effect</h3> 
<ol>
	<li>
		Describes whether the effect of the impact is <i>positive</i> or <i>negative</i>. 
	</li>
	<li>
		If the impact has a positive effect, the degree of which the 
		product possesses the target factor is heightened if the product possesses the source factor.
		In contrast, if the impact has a negative effect, the degree of which the target factor is 
		possessed by the product is hindered if the product possesses the source factor.
