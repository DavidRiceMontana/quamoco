<h1>Evaluation</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
An evaluation describes how to calculate 
the degree to which the factor is present is a system under analysis. 

There are various ways to calculate an evaluation, i.e., 
by using the predefined operations for a <a href="SingleMeasureEvaluation.html">single measure</a> or  
the <a href="WeightedSumFactorAggregation.html">weighted sum for factors</a>, 
by writting <a href="QieslEvaluation.html">QIESL syntax</a> or 
a simple <a href="TextEvaluation.html">textual specification</a>, 
as well as performing a <a href="ManualEvaluation.html">manual evaluation</a>.
</div>

<h2>General Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>When evaluating a factor based on measures use only measures that are defined there (and a normalization measure for normalizing).</li>
	<li>When evaluating a factor based on factors use only factors that refine the factor or have an impact.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Attributes</h2>

<h3 class="attribute">Qualified Name</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		The qualified name is the identifier used to refer to the evaluation. It is generated
		automatically based on the name of the factor and of the evaluation.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Name</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		The default is <i>Evaluation</i>. You can optionally give it a specific name, for example,
		if you want to have different evaluations for a factor.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Title</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		A title is an optional additional name for the evaluation.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Description</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		This can be used to textually describe and explain the evaluation.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Maximum Points</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		A factor is always evaluated using points.
		Provide the number of points that can be archived by an assessment for this factor 
		in the best case. By default, the values is 100.
	</li>
	<li>
		An evaluation result of 0 Points means that a factor is not present.
		An evaluation result with maxPoints means that the factor is full present.
	</li>
	<li>
		For <a href="Factor.html#productfactor">product factors</a> and
		<a href="Factor.html#ilitiesfactor">-ilities factors</a>  
		points are used to characterize the degree to which a factor is present in the software product.
		For <a href="Factor.html#usecasefactor">use case factors</a> they are used
		to characterize the degree to which the use case satisfies the factor. 
		For <a href="Factor.html#satisfactionfactor">stakeholder satisfaction factors</a> they are used
		to characterize the degree to which the stakeholder is satisfied. 
	</li>
</ol>
