<h1>Measure</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
A measure defines how a specific entity is measured. For the concrete measurement,
it defines either an instrument, which is bound to a tool or manual measurement, or
an aggregation of other measures.
</div>

<h2>General Rules</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use measures to quantify factors.</li>
<li>Use measures to model checklist items for manual reviews.</li>
<li>For normalizing purposes at an evaluation use <a href="NormalizationMeasure.html">normalization measures</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<h3 class="attribute">Qualified Name</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		The qualified name is generated automatically based on the name and the characterizing entity.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Name</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Choose a short, descriptive name for the measure. 
	</li>
	
	<li>
	If there is no specific reason to do otherwise, only captialise the first word in the name.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Characterizes</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Specify the entity that is characterized by the measure.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Title</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		A title can be an alternative, more readable identifier for the measure.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Providing a title is optional.
	</li>

	<li>
	If there is no specific reason to do otherwise, only captialise the first word in the title.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Description</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Describe what the measure is intended to measure.
	</li>
	<li>
		What does it actually measure?
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Type</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Set one of <i>NONE</i>, <i>FINDINGS</i>, <i>NUMBER</i>.
	</li>
	<li>
		In many cases, <i>FINDINGS</i> is an appropriate type. 
		Measures that represent rules that are checked on a product can identify locations in the product where the rule is violated. 
		Such a location is called finding.
		Most of static code analysis tools, for example, return findings. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Measures can return an arbitrary real numerical value. 
		The data type to represent them is <i>NUMBER</i>. 
		This number can be an absolute value or a ratio of some kind, it is mostly appropriate for numerical measures.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Refined by / Refines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		A measure can be consists of other measures. In this case, a measure is
		<i>refined by</i> other measures.
	</li>
</ol>
