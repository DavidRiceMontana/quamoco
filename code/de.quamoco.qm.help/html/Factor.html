<h1>Factor</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
Factors are one of the basic elements of quality models. A factor constitutes a 
property of the software product (or a part of it) that is related to the product’s quality. A factor 
is always defined in a way, that it is possible to talk about the degree to which it 
is present in a product that is assessed. The factor can be further defined by 
characterizing an entity, but it does not have to define an entity. 
<br>
The terms <i>attribute</i> and <i>property</i> are used interchangeably 
in the literature. Here, we chose the term <i>factor</i> to clearly distinguish it from the 
term quality attribute defined in ISO 9126 [ISO9126].
</div>

<h2>General Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Use a factor to define a property of an entity entity in a textual descriptive way.
	</li>

	<li>Provide textual criteria in the factor's description that defines when 
		an entity exhibits the property and when not.</li>

	<li>Create a factor before you think about the measures that quantify it.
		This is helpful to ensure that you measure what you really want to measure.
		Furthermore, it helps to create factors at the right level of abstraction, 
		preventing the quantitative explosion of factors and impacts.
	</li>
	
	<li>There are different types of factors:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#productfactor">Product Factor</a></li>
			<li><a href="#ilitiesfactor">Product Quality Attribute (ISO 25010)</a></li>
			<li><a href="#usecasefactor">Quality in Use Attribute (ISO 25010)</a></li>
			<li><a href="#satisfactionfactor">Stakeholder Satisfaction</a></li>
			<li><a href="#ticfactor">Technical Issue</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<h3 class="attribute">Qualified Name</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		The qualified name identifies the factor; it is generated automatically based on the name and the characterizing entity (if set).
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Name</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		The name of a factor should be an adjective.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		If it is not possible to find an adjective, formulate the factor name
		in a way that the factor can be pronounced as:
		&lt;entity&gt; must be / must have &lt;name&gt;
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Try to use the same name in combination with different entities if you 
		intent to characterize them with respect to common property. A large 
		collection of viable names can be found in the base model. 
	</li> 
	
	<li>
		If there is no specific reason to do otherwise, only captialize the first word in the name.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Characterizes</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Specify the entity that is characterized by the factor.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Title</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		A factor can have an optional title. 
	</li>
	<li>
		The title can be used to provide a more verbose description of the factors, beside the name.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Description</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Provide a comprehensive textual criteria in the factor's description that defines 
		when an entity exhibits the property and when not. 
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="relationrefines" />
<h3 class="attribute">Refined by / Refines</h3> 
<ol>
	<li>
		Factors are organized in a hierarchy through a
		refinement relation. 
	</li>
	<li>Refinement can only be used between of factors of
		the same type, e.g., product-factors may only refine 
		product factors.
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="relationimpact" />
<h3 class="attribute">Influenced by / Influences</h3> 
<ol>
	<li>
		Factors may influence each other, which is modeled as
		an <a href="Impact.html">Impact</a>. 
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="attribute">Measured By</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Factors can be quantified by one or more  <a href="measure.html">measures</a>. 
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="productfactor" />
<h1>Product Factor</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
Product factors are properties of specific parts of the software product. These parts
are specified as artefacts or <a href="entity.html#product"/>product entities</a>, such as, 
Conciseness @Identifier or Appropriateness @Comment.
</div>
<ol>
	<li>
		Use product factors to characterize parts of the software.
	</li>
	<li>
		A product factor must make sense, without referring to the impact.
		<br>
		<b>Positive example:</b> [Structuredness @Expression].<br>
		The structuredness is defined, independent of the impact it has on understandability.
		<br>
		<b>Negative example:</b> [Efficiency @Expression].<br>
		You should not introduce this factor and use it to collect all measures that have an impact on performance.
		Not doing so, assures that a new measure can be uniquely assigned to a factor, without having in mind its impact.
	</li>
	<li>
		An impact of a product-factor to a <i>product quality attribute</i> or a <i>quality in use factor</i> 
		should point to a leaf in the hierarchy.
		<br>
		This way it is assured that a justification is given for each of the impacted factors. 
		<br>
		Example: Instead of modeling an impact to [Maintainability] you should model two impacts to
			[Analyzability], [Modifyability] and give a special justification for both of them. If you would
			only model one impact to [Maintainability] the justification is less clearer.
	</li>
		
</ol>

<h1>Product Quality Attribute (ISO 25010)</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
Product quality attributes define one way to decompose the abstract concept software
quality. These quality attributes, as given in ISO 25010, relate to the quality of
the product without explicitly considering its use.   

These quality attributes are colloquially called -illities, because they contain,
for example, reliability or maintainability. In the standard, the top level attributes
are refined by so-called quality characteristics.

</div> 
<ol>
	<li>
		Product quality attributes model the -ilities of the ISO 25010.
	</li>
	<li>
		These factors do characterize the entity <i>Product</i>.
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="usecasefactor" />
<h1>Quality in Use Attribute</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
Quality in use attributes define a way to decompose the abstract concept software quality.
These quality attributes are defined in the ISO 25010 as description of the quality in its
various forms of usage. Examples are efficiency or effectiveness.

To be more precise, we add the <a href="entity.html#usecase">activity</a> that is characterised
by the attribute as entity to the factor. 
Activities like maintenance, program comprehension, modification, or testing, which 
can be decomposed in their respective sub-activities, provide a means to model software 
development cost structures.
</div>

<ol>
	<li>
		The entity of a quality in use attribute is an <a href="entity.html#usecase">activity</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Characterize an activity by:
		<ul>
			<li>Effectiveness</li>
			<li>Efficiency</li>
			<li>Safety</li>
			<li>Satisfaction</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="satisfactionfactor" />
<h1>Stakeholder Satisfaction</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
On a high level of abstraction, product quality contributes to the 
satisfaction of specific stakeholders. This can also be modeled using 
the  <a href="entity.html#stakeholder">stakeholder</a> as an entity.
</div>

<ol>
	<li>
		The entity of a stakeholder satisfaction is a <a href="entity.html#stakeholder">stakeholder</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		These factors have always the name "Satisfaction".
	</li>
</ol>



<a name="ticfactor" />
<h1>Technical Issue</h1>

<div class="excerpt">
Technical issues are also a way to decompose the abstract concept of quality. This is a
technical view, which assigns problems to areas such as memory or declaration.
</div>

<ol>
	<li>
		TIC factors do not characterize specific entities.
	</li>
</ol>
